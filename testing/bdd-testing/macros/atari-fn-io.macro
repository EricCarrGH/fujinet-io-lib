Given common atari-fn-io test setup
  Given I have a simple overclocked 6502 system
    And I enable trace with indent
    And I create or clear directory "build/tests"
    And I load labels "features/atari/inc/test_constants.inc"

# More complex test that sets up a full application to run, establishing Stack Pointer (SP) etc
# test asm must have _main, and test feature calls _init to run
Given atari-fn-io application test setup
  Given common atari-fn-io test setup
    # we do need some compiler target here, going to try none over atari
    And I start compiling for none in "build/tests" with config "features/test-setup/inc/fn-io-app.cfg"
    # These must come after the "start compiling"
    And I add compiler option "--asm-include-dir features/atari/inc"
